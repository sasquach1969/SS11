 Linux notes beginning at 1/1/18 when I switched from Windows to Fedora Linux.<br>
============================================================================<br>
 Fedora 27 64bit LXDE Changelog. 
 Every update of this file should be considered a complete replacement of the prior version.<br>
 and not just the latest add-ons. Any item here may be changed between versions as I learn new things.<br>
 On 1-1-18, I switched from Windows 7 X64 Pro to Linux-Fedora-27-X64-LXDE to Linux.Fredora.64.XFCE.<br>

 <h1>SECTION B</h1>
 
 01) To Autorun a CLI command at login (not boot)<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) Go to  /home/j.mander/.config/autostart (replace j.mander with your user name)<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Create a file named (whatever).desktop  (must end in .desktop)<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) The following is the format for the file.<br><br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;[Desktop Entry]<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Type=Application<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Exec=/usr/bin/firefox<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Name=Firefox<br><br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Of course, the example will load Firefox on login. Customize the path<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;and name to the application you want to launch at login. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;***NOTE - with XFCE, there is a much easier way.*** <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See Start&gt;Settings&gt;Session and Startup&gt;Application Autostart.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;These isems are stored in the root directory: /etc/xdg/autostart/<br><br>
 02) Ubuntu documentation - https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/ubuntu-help/index.html<br><br>
 03) Unit files are loaded from two locations. From lowest to highest precedence they are:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;/usr/lib/systemd/system/ : units provided by installed packages. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;/etc/systemd/system/ : units installed by the system administrator.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use systemctl enable and the program name to create a link that allows a file to load on startup.<br><br>
 04) Power Manager is counterproductive for wifi connections. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To stop the constant reconnecting, and restore full power to the adaptor:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Tadd (copy and paste) as a section to /etc/NetworkManager.conf...<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;[connection]<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;# Values are 0 (use default), 1 (ignore/don't touch), 2 (disable) or 3 (enable).<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;wifi.powersave = 2<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;After changes are made NM will need to be restarted to take effect<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Code:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager (or better yet,reboot)<br><br>
 05) Use crontab -e to schedule programs To save and exit alt+wq to just exit alt+q!  <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use i to insert esc to leave insert mode.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To write a log file and auto yes to install, use <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;40 06 * * * dnf update -y  &gt;/home/j.mander/Documents/log.log<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;This will check for updates each day at  6:40 am and write the results to the log file.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://www.howtogeek.com/101288/how-to-schedule-tasks-on-linux-an-introduction-to-crontab-files/<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To clean the memory hourly and also perform updates once a day, use<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;20 05 * * * dnf update -y --best --allowerasing &gt;/home/ss10/Desktop/update.log<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;0 */1 * * * sync; echo 1 &gt;/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches &gt;/home/ss10/Desktop/update.log<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;or to recycle ram at any time from the $ prompt, just type sync.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;***Note: if you want to edit the root cron in leafpad (must be root) it is at /var/spool/cron<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To perform an action every 10 minutes, the syntax is  */10 * * * * /path/to/command  See<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/crontab-every-10-min/<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Where is cron file?<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The individual user cron files are located in /var/spool/cron, and system services and <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;applications generally add cron job files in the /etc/cron.d directory.<br><br>
 06) Full clock format code is  %A %m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p  or  %m/%d/%y%n%H:%M:%S<br><br>
 07) Go to "start"&gt;Preferences&gt;Desktop Session Settings. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Uncheck Spice vdagent and other startups you dont need.<br><br>
 08) In CLI (Command Line Interface), use ps -Al  or top  to view running processes.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://www.lifewire.com/uses-of-linux-ps-command-4058715<br><br>
 09) See what is happening at post. (Turn off the graphic at bootup.) <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;As root (#) run pcmanfm. Go to  /boot/grub2/grub.cfg. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Search for RHGB (red hat graphical boot) and delete it.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Your device will now return to text mode durring post (boot) <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;to let you catch errors and see activity real time.<br><br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See this: https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2021/07/disable-manufacturer-logo-show-boot-message-ubuntu/
 10) *VNC* In CLI, launch the remote desktop server with:  <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;x11vnc -forever -usepw -shared -ncache_cr<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See this web page for setup and autostart:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://askubuntu.com/questions/229989/how-to-setup-x11vnc-to-access-with-graphical-login-screen#274485<br><br>
 11) A Poem.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Rotten Apples, broken Windows, there's another option here.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Turning from the brainwashed masses, there stands Linux free and clear.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;It has daemons, it needs tweaking, yes it has a learning curve.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Still it does what you command, unlike the others that you serve. - Paul Franklin 04/08/18 <br><br>
 12) Most user applications on can be found in &gt; /usr/share/applications<br><br>
 13) To check your operating system version (from root in CLI) type: cat  /etc/*release*<br><br>
 14) To create a desktop shortcut, right click on the menu item and select "add to desktop" or do it manually.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://lkubaski.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/adding-lxde-start-menu-and-desktop-shortcuts/<br><br>
 15) Install VBOX to try other operating systems safely.<br><br>

 17) To add or remove items from the Application Launch Bar (in the task bar after the CLI icon), right <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;click on CLI and click "Application Launch Bar Settings" (Should be top option.)<br><br>
 18) LXDE tweaks - Link 1 = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsOo_ulnrlw<br><br>
 19) Update your device and reboot once a week for best results.<br><br>
 20) If you are using the Gnome desktop and there is no logout option. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Type the following in CLI to logout.gnome-session-quit<br><br>
 21) To see local wifi from CLI, type:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;$ nmcli dev wifi<br><br>
 22) To change a usb drive name, use the "Disks" utility:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) unmount the drive, right click on the square.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Go to options, click on the gears.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) click on edit file system and rename<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) Remount the drive.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See this - https://askubuntu.com/questions/103686/how-do-i-rename-a-usb-drive#233681<br><br>
 23) To prevent eye strain, use a dark theme like ACL-DARK go to start&gt;settings&gt;appearence&gt;ARC-DARK<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;This will also switch the desktop icon labels back to normal and remove the boxes.<br><br>
 24) To see how much memory is in use of free, (at the CLI prompt) simply type free<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To disable the swap file and use only physical ram (much faster) as root go to /etc/fstab and <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;comment out the line about the swap file by putting a # at the start of that line.<br><br>
 25) To find the ip address of a website, us nslookup. (Ex. $ nslookup google.com)<br><br>
 26) To free ram on linux (must be root) type (at #) sync; echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Be sure to add this to crontab for regular cleaning and bes performance.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To do this once an hour (recommended) you would set the time for 0 */1 * * * <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To disable or enable the swap file, use the "disks" utility.<br><br>
 27) To search for a file from CLI, (must be root) use    # find / -name "123" (Replace 123 with file name).<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To see all installed packages, type:  apt list --installed<br><br>
 28) The XFCE shortcut to close an open window is CTL+F4.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;More XFCE desktop shortcuts are here: <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://keyboardshortcuts.org/list-of-keyboard-shortcuts<br><br>
 29) Nautilus is the default file manager for some desktops but it has known bugs.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Verify that you have PCmanFM File manager installed. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;You can do this from CLI or with dnfdragora like I did.<br><br>
 30) To use VSFTPD (very secure ftp deamon) see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqVQFIFx1Zk<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Unfortunately this fails to provide a proper gui so CLI is all it has. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;NOTE! NO LONGER RECOMMENDED TO USE ANY REMOTE DESKTOP SERVICE 2024<br><br>
 31) To create a "quicklaunch" area to the right of the start button (in XFCE), right click to the task bar<br> 
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;and select "Panel" then "add new items" then "Launcher". A launcher will appera at the right end of your <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;task bar. Next, right click on that launcher then left click on properties. Use the "+" to designate the <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;program to launch. Then,double click the program from that list and the launcher will link to it. Next, <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;right click on the new launcher and select move. Move the mouse to the location on the task bar where you <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;want it and left click to drop.<br><br>
 32) Sizing on drives and other storage media may be calculated in base 10 or base 2. We normally use base 10<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;but computers use base 2. See this link for clearification and why your drive may read smaller than expected.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://blog.digilentinc.com/mib-vs-mb-whats-the-difference/   (ex. 250 GB = 232 GiB &amp; 3TB = 2.72848 TiB).<br><br>
 33) Install ffmpeg to manage and manipulate video. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See this: https://www.techgalery.com/2019/11/ffmpeg-commands-to-make-mirrored-video.html<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;and https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html<br><br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To convert all mpg or avi files in a folder to mp4, navagate in CLI to the folder then type:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;$ for i in *.mpg; do ffmpeg -i "$i" "${i%.*}.mp4"; done   (no need for root).<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To batch convert mp4 to mp3 files in a folder, use this:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;S for i in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i "$i" "${i%.*}.mp3"; done   (no need for root).<br><br>
 34) Use sudo apt install lshw lshw-gui to install Hardware Lister diagnostic software with gui.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See - https://ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter#Download<br><br>
 35) To view System Info. from CLI, use: # lshw -short &gt;/home/*username*/Desktop/lshw.txt  <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;(Of coarse, replace *username* with your real user name.)<br><br>
 36) Linux CLI commands - a short list<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://techhowdy.com/terminal-commands-for-linux/<br><br>
 37) To ping an address or site 3 times and stop, use ping www.google.com -c 3 (replace www.google.com with address)<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;https://vitux.com/linux-ping-command/<br><br>
 38) To eject the DVD drawer (if present), use eject /dev/cdrom   To close it, use  eject -t<br><br>
 39) To hide programs from a user,<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) SU to root in CLI   2)run pcmanfm   3) Go to /usr/share/applications<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Right click on the selected item(s) and click on permissions.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) Set all 3 areas to "Only user and group".<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;E) Make sure all other users are in a seperate or different group than the owner.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use the "Users and Groups" utility to easily manage those. Then do the above.<br><br>
 40) Panel add-on xfce4-weather-plugin is very useful and can be run in any panel.<br><br>
 41) To load Google Chrome in the background on startup for faster launching, <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Session and Startup &gt; Application Autostart &gt; Add<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Name is  Google Chrome.  Command is  /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --no-startup-window<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Click ok and close windows then reboot to take affect.<br><br>
 42) Install hardinfo utility which has a gui and can give you lots of usefull computer information.<br><br>
 43) When running a web server (apache aka httpd) you can adjust how often log files are created by <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;using logrotate following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2RMbzKUCY<br>
 
<h1>SECTION C</h1>

 Learned items since switching to Ubuntu + XFCE4 on 12.1.19.<br>
 Most of the above notes are still usefull in Ubuntu (use apt not dnf in Ubuntu).<br>
 Count starts over with the Xubuntu system. If asking a question about a numbered point,
 be sure to specify section letter and point number.<br><br>

 01) Save a lot of steps by installing Xubuntu LTE.<br><br>
 02) Use the following as root to disable lock on sleep: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver ubuntu-lock-on-suspend false<br><br>
 03) Ubuntu uses apt where Fedora uses DNF or YUM. Other commands are similar.(apt includes apt-get).<br><br>
 04) It is recommended to disable the Powersaver with: xset -dpms<br><br>
 05) Turn off screen blanking with: xset s off (see: https://linuxreviews.org/<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;HOWTO_turn_Screensavers_and_Monitor_Power_Saving_on_and_off)<br><br>
 06) Ubuntu installs .deb (Debian) packaged as apposed to the .rpm (Red Hat) packages of Fedora.<br><br>
 07) Install the following packages: vlc, google-chrome, libreoffice, gimp, audacity, DeVeDe, leafpad, synaptic, <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;brasero, screenfetch, Filezilla, PCmanFM, weather-plugin, blueman, catfish, kdenlive, vsftpd, httpd, xfburn, <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;xdotool, bleachbit, &amp; virtualbox.(Some may be native to your operating system. Check before installing.)<br><br>
 08) Ubuntu is not recommended for systems with less that 4GB of RAM. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements)<br><br>
 09) To reach root on Ubuntu, simply use 'sudo -i' (without the apostrophies / 'single quotes').<br><br>
 10) SNAP is another software source. To download from snap, use: sudo snap install ... all else use: sudo apt install...<br><br>
 11) Use: sudo apt install dconf-editor to install a manager that tweaks your login/out menu. USE WITH CAUTION.<br><br>
 12) If the software manager cant install a package, sometimes CLI still can.<br><br>
 13) Add-ons to the XFCE toolbar are the same cross platform (ex: xfce4-weather-plugin)<br><br>
 14) Use: sudo apt autoremove to remove packages that are no longer needed.<br><br>
 15) There are many add-ons for XFCE, see: https://docs.xfce.org/start<br><br>
 16) Bash Scripts are just text files that have the first line of: "#!/bin/bash" used to automate commands.<br><br>
 17) Use a script to automate updates and turn 3 steps into 1. update, upgrade, and autoremove.<br><br>
 18) Avoid Microsoft addons like Powershell and Skype. Keep your system pure. Only GPL freeware.<br><br>
 19) Consolidate the desktop by moving launchers from the second panel into the first. Remove the second panel. (XFCE4).<br><br>
 20) To use ftp in passive mode from CLI us ftp -p (address).<br><br>
 21) For XFCE4 on a portable device, add: XFCE4-power-manager. Brightness control and more.<br><br>
 22) Other XFCE4 plug-ins are here: https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/start<br><br>
 23) Set VSFTPD server to passive mode - https://serverfault.com/questions/421161/how-to-configure-vsftpd-to-work-with-passive-mode<br><br>
 24) The XFCE4 user guide online is here: https://docs.xfce.org/<br><br>
 25) Right click Ubuntu's workspace switcher &gt; workspace settings &gt; left click margins to correct full screen window overflow.<br><br>
 26) Install xdotool to automate mouse clicks and key presses. See http://xmodulo.com/simulate-key-press-mouse-movement-linux.html<br><br>
 27) To view the live mouse coordinates, run this is a new CLI: while true; do xdotool getmouselocation; sleep 0.2; clear; done<br><br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Taken from site: https://askubuntu.com/questions/346913/show-realtime-mouse-cursor-coordinates-cursor-mod-overlay-also-copy-to-c<br><br>
 28) After installing Ubuntu, but before xfce4, run # "apt install libexo-1-0"  this bridges the desktop and menu links.Or better just install Xubuntu.<br><br>
 29) To ping an ip address, be sure to add -c3 at the end (with the space) or you will get an unending ping cycle.<br><br>
 30) Ubuntu linux contains 'DD' just like Fedora. See this:  https://linuxhint.com/dd_command_linux/<br><br>
 31) For Brasero to work correctly, also install the following:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;(This worked for me) from https://askubuntu.com/questions/1052993/how-to-install-libdvdcss-so-2-library-to-ubuntu-18-04<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) sudo apt install libdvdnav4 libdvdread4 gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly libdvd-pkg<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras<br><br>
 32) Install classicmenu-indicator to have a clean dropdown menu that loads faster. Or newer, whisker menu is even better.<br><br>
 33) If you run another command using sudo within five minutes of running the first one, you will not be asked for your password again.<br><br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) ctl+z = undo, ctl+c = copy, ctl+v = paste, super+d = show desktop (toggle), ctl+f = find, etc.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;E) No window border? No problem. If using the XFCE Desktop Environment (DE):<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;From: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/156435/how-can-i-make-windows-easier-to-resize-in-xfce<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;2 options. Use Alt+left mouse button to move a window or use Alt+right mouse button to resize a window<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;*or*<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;After you make your changes, use: xfce4-panel -r  to reload the panel with the new settings.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See this link for more:  https://www.reddit.com/r/xfce/comments/kghsiz/round_xfce4panel/<br><br>
 90) Take advantage of menus supplied by icons in the task bar. Right click on one and see the features it provides.<br><br>
 91) While the speed of all hardware is important, many people overlook hard drive read/write speed and focus on the CPU and ram.<br>

 98) Some programs are installed automaticly that we do NOT want on our systems. They will be listed here and we highly recommend removing them.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) unattended-upgrades   -   This package will waste ram and cpu in the background. Crontab can schedue an update anytime.<br><br>
 99) Using CLI to zip or unsip files is easy. Most Linux versions have the Zip and Unzip utilities already installed.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The syntax is:  zip filename.zip  file1 file2 file3.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To Unzip just use:  unzip filename.zip<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See: https://itsfoss.com/apt-remove-purge/<br><br> 
 105) Command Line Interface (CLI) plus Graphical User Interface (GUI) = Hybrid user and much less time wasted typing.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Example.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) Open a browser window to a directory of files.<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) Drag a file from the browser window (GUI) to the space after wget in the CLI.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;E) Press enter in the CLI and see the file download to your desktop. Helpfil in scripts.<br><br>
 106) If you have any issues with the XFCE panal (aka toolbar / taskbar) displaying properly, try:  xfce4-panel -r   to reset it.<br><br>
 107) To see the built in manual information for any CLI command, type:  man (command name). Example: $man apt <br><br>
 108) To copy a Graphcal File Manager (GFM) folder to a terminal (CLI) prompt, try this with XFCE:<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Drag the folder or file icon into the CLI at the prompt.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Use this after any CLI command like: nano, wget (for files), or any standard CLI command.<br> 
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Note - This works when "Copy File Path" does not.<br><br>
 109) When writing a bash script for linux which includes the user name but must be comapatable on multple machines with different user names,<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Type: tail -f (log file name) (not compressed file.)<br><br>
 112) To create a live monitor file of the Apache2 webserver, type: /var/log/apache2# tail -f other_vhosts_access.log &gt;&gt; /var/www/html/public/log.txt<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;This must be done as root on the machine with the server. This requires an open bash session.<br><br>
 113) To log in to a remote server automaticly in CLI or in a script, use the following syntax:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Install sshpass on your local machine.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) sshpass -p password ssh username@server<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) To login to a specific directory, add the following syntax.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Example  sshpass -p password ssh -t username@server  "cd ~/Desktop; bash -l"<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The result of the above is user@server:~/Desktop$<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) Change the path in the example above to reflect the directory you wish to enter on connection.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/626533/how-can-i-ssh-directly-to-a-particular-directory<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-applesox-ssh-password-on-command-line #:~:text=You%20need%20to%20use%20the,but%20in%20non%2Dinteractive%20mode.<br><br>
 114) To download HD videos from Youtube or vimeo, with yt-dlp, use the following:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;yt-dlp --merge-output-format mp4 -f "bestvideo+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best" (url)<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;For normal quality downloads, use the following:<br>  
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;yt-dlp -f b (url) See: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-youtube-videos-using-yt-dlp/<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use yt-dlp URL --write-thumbnail  To just download the video and the thumbnail.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use yt-dlp URL --write-thumbnail --skip-download To only download a thumbnail. <br> 
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use yt-dlp URL -x --audio-format mp3  to save a video as an mp3 file.<br><br> 
 115) If you set a machine to auto login and want to switch it back, follow these steps:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) Open a terminal window and log in as root.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Use groups (user name) without parentheses to see what groups your user belongs to.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Look for group nopasswdlogin. If there, we need to delete it by the next step.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) Type:  gpasswd -d nopasslogin (user name). Then reboot. May not take effect until reboot.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The main reason one would want to go back to a login with password is that this unlocks the keyring and other things.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;If set to autologin, the user will still be asked to unlock the keyring so why not do it all at once?<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See : https://www.tecmint.com/add-or-remove-user-from-group-in-linux/<br><br>
 117) To display the full name (not trunkated) of the desktop icon labels, try this:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) Type: nano ~/.conf/gtk-3.0/gtk.css<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Paste the following in that file:  * {  -XfdesktopIconView-ellipsize-icon-labels: 0;}<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Save, exit, log-out, log-in, see the change. To revert, remove the line you just added.<br><br>
 118) Use the following to rip a dvd to iso with Linux DD:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) Determine the drive name (example /dev/sr1) with: lsblk |grep rom<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Determine the volume and block size with: isoinfo -d -i /dev/sr1 | grep -i -E 'block size|volume size'<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Use DD to rip the file: dd if=/dev/sr1 of=/home/user name/Desktop/name.iso bs=2048 count=2585504 status=progress<br><br>
 119) Use xllvnc server for remote desktop sharing. This has a gui but can run from cli with:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;x11vnc -passwd (your-password) -noxdamage -forever<br><br>
 120) Use the following to list installed packages using the dpkg utility.<br>

 121) To turn off the counterprouctive password syntax requirements:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) Open terminal and switch to root.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;B) Type nano /etc/pam.d/common-password<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;C) Replace:  password    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so obscure yescrypt<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;With:     password    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so minlen=1 sha512<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;D) Press ctl+s to save and ctl+x to exit. Now you can use any password and any length.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;See:  https://askubuntu.com/questions/113682/how-to-change-disable-password-complexity-test-when-changing-password<br><br>
 122) To make things simple, add aliases to the bottom of the .bashrc file.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; Instead of typing: sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo apt autoremove -y<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; every time you do an update (or any other long command string) create a shortcut in .bashrc with alias<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; use nano to edit the .bashrc file and place the alias string at the bottom of the file.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; In this case it would be: alias up='sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo apt autoremove -y'<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; Next time you open terminal, use the up command. Restart your terminal for these changes to take sffect.<br><br>
 123) Anti virus software is not needed on Linux but a firewall is a very good idea. We recommend UFW. (Uncomplicated Firewall).<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; A) install ufw and gufw (the latter is a gui if desired but not required for advanced users)<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; B) In CLI, switch to root and type systemctl enable ufw<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; C) The graphical interface must be launched as root. Type: $ sudo gufw<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; #!/bin/bash<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; status=$(xset -q | grep Caps | awk '{print $2 $3 $4, $6 $7 $8}')<br>

 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; TOOLTIP+="</tool>"<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;   echo -e "${PANEL}"<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;   echo -e "${TOOLTIP}"<br><br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; I did a little research and experimentation and came up with a simpler, double stack option in the script:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; #!/bin/bash<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; status1=$(xset -q | grep Caps | awk '{print $2,$4}')<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; status2=$(xset -q | grep Caps | awk '{print $6, $8}')<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; PANEL="<txt> $status1 \n $status2 </txt>"; echo -e "${PANEL}"<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; Use tip 125 below to load this script into the xfce panel.<br><br>
 125) You can use a GenMon or (Generic Monitor) xfce panel plugin to display the output of a script in the panel.<br>

 128) Linux is case sensative. Stop, sTop,stOp,stoP,StOp,sToP, STop,StoP, etc. are all different files.<br><br>
 129) The Linux trash folder is located in each user folder at: ~/.local/share/Trash/files/<br><br>
 130) In the CLI,  ~/  is short hand for /home/$USER/...<br><br>
 131) In the CLI, * is a wild card. So to view all of the  .txt  files in a folder, type:  ls *.txt<br><br>
 132) In the CLI, type: tree directory to see a tree of folders and files<br><br>
 133) When using the THUNAR file manager to access the files on a remote server, you may need to reload the file manager<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;to connect if you receive error messages when choosing a remote folder. To do this use: thunar -q &amp;&amp; thunar &amp;<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;otherwise you would have to log out and log back in to gain access to these remote folders and files.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;This also applies to other file managers like PCMANFM and others.<br><br>
 134) Here is an explanation regarding the use of  -  vs  -- in CLI commands: <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Source: https://askubuntu.com/questions/492544/what-are-the-differences-between-and-in-commands<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;As explained above be careful to use the exact syntax. Example: -R and -r provide different results<br><br>
 135) To automaticly enable number lock on at boot (not after loggin) follow these steps using CLI:<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;A) $ sudo gedit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-xubuntu-numlock.conf<br>

 139) Using imagemajick to create web pages of thumbnails. Use "convert" not "majick".<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Read this first - https://askubuntu.com/questions/1315603/where-is-the-magick-command-of-imagemagick.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then see this - https://legacy.imagemagick.org/Usage/thumbnails/#html<br><br>
 140) Use "xdg-open" followed by a file path to open that file with the default designated program for files of that type.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Example xdg-open http://google.com will open google in your default browser.<br><br>
 141) To call the default CLI app, use: x-terminal-emulator. <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To launch a command in a new terminal window, use:  x-terminal-emulator -e sudo "command".<br><br>
 142) To find the biggest files on your drive, use:  "du -aBM |sort -nr |head -n 10" without the quotes.<br>

 143) EXTREMELY IMPORTEANT!!!<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;There is NO SUCH THING as secure remote control. My server has been attacked and reloaded almost from scratch 2 times in 33 years.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The first by an encrypted VNC connection, and the second in 11/23 by an encrypted SSH connection. VPN might be an option but since <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;security was a lie about the first two, I am not ready to trust that yet.<br><br>
 144) When performing an update &amp; upgrade from terminal, you may see "libdvd-pkg: `apt-get check` failed, you may have broken packages. Aborting"<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Use the following to resolve it.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;If this problem persist, you can select not to do "automatic" updates.<br>  
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Source: https://snapoverflow.com/ubuntu/question/1094062/libdvd-pkg-apt-get-check-failed-you-may-have-broken-packages-aborting/ <br><br>
 145) For best results in CLI, to find a file, use locate. Not find. The results are much more concise.<br><br>
 146) C:\ drive in Windows is /mnt/c/ in WSL Ubuntu (Windows 11). <br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;BTW, WSL is the Windows Virtual Machine platform. Best with Ubuntu.<br><br>
 147) To zoom in and out on the Linux Desktop (or anything on it) press alt and scroll the mouse wheel.<br><br>
 148) To use A.I. on your local Linux machine, download Ollama, then follow these directions: https://zahiralam.com/blog/how-to-install-llama-3-1-on-ubuntu-24-04/<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The best model is ollama run llama3.1:8b. The other models respond very slowly even oh high powered machines.<br><br>
 149) To batch scale videos in a folder for better streaming, use "for f in *.mp4 ; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -vf scale=1280:720 "720_$f" ;  done"  in that directory.<br><br>
 150) To launch a file in a new terminal window, use (example only):  x-terminal-emulator -e ./YT-Downloader.sh<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Replace x-terminal-emulator with the name of your terminal or cli program.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Replace ./YT-Downloader.sh with the name of the file you wish to run in the new terminal window.<br><br>
 151) To easily arrange the icons on your desktop, place this in a script, place it on yout desktop, and make it executable:  xfdesktop -A<br><br>   
 152) To render a section of the timeline in the Kdenlive video editor, see this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H40NjcW2Cs<br><br>
 153) For best restore from suspend/sleep mode, always close (not minimize) all open windows or apps first.<br><br>
 154) To format drives using NTFS, you need to install the ntfs-3g package with  udo apt install ntfs-3g <br><br>
 155) To view the history of laptop lid opens and closes, use: 'cat /var/log/auth.log |grep -a Lid' <br><br>  
 156) Resources for packages are ppa sourses. Currently found in /etc/apt/sources.list.d<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;If you run update and find broken source errors, you can delete the sources there.<br>
 &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;If you receive a "held broken packages" error, it simply means it was not installed.<br><br>
