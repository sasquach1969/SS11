 SASQUACH SERVER is on it's 11th major upgrade since it was created in 1990. It is multifaceted, working as a host for both local and remote users. Primarily for  the proliferation and propagation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Secondarily, it is a web hosting service and cloud storage for it's owners. At this time, NO A.I. is in use by this server. Security is important so we upgraded from Windows to Linux on 1/1/2018. Updated 11/06/23. <br><br>
Are you a christian? ... Really?<br><br>
 Many religions claim to be <i>Christian</i> but fail to align with God's plan of salvation in the Bible. Salvation is not just an escape from Hell or an add on to your current life style like a lucky charm. This is a total change in the trajectory of your life. When the first man Adam sinned, there was a curse called the sin nature introduced. We are all born with this sin nature. We are not sinners because we sin or (better people if we dont) we sin because we are sinners. Heaven is a perfect place and God is perfect. As such, He cannot accept sinful people in Heaven or have a close relationship with them. To bridge this gap between the perfect and all of us who have been polluted by inheriting a sin nature from Adam,  Jesus Christ came to Earth in the form of a man to be the sacrifice required for sin. All actions have consequences and justice requires restitution or payment for wrong. But God the son (Jesus) acted in mercy to give us a path to restored fellowship with God both here and in the life to come. True salvation is not about religion. It is about a real life relationship with a living God and a turning away from running our lives our own way. Both of those are important. We dont just ask Jesus into our hearts, we first must confess that we are sinners and need forgiveness.  It is a conscious commitment to live life Gods way by his power. Will we be perfect after salvation? Not in this lifetime. But after salvation, it is a matter of growth and feeding on Godly input that will change our lives for the better. Nothing you can do will save you. Not baptism, not going to church, not, living a good life, not doing good works, not attending church, or any other man made futile work. Salvation is a gift from God which was paid for by Jesus alone and it is free to you. Make no mistake, the price of this gift was expensive but you cant and dont have to pay for it. No one knows how long they have before they die and then it is too late to choose. There is no purgatory or middle ground. The Bible makes this very clear. While the sin nature condemns us to Hell and separation from Gods love, Gods mercy provided a payment for us and a way to restore fellowship with our maker. It was this same Jesus who created everything we see and the universe it is in. He wanted us then and still wants us today for a love that we can hardly wrap our heads around. This is not a feelings based or emotional thing. It is a decision to give God control of our thoughts and lives from the point of salvation and going forward. You wont regret it. Life is hard, but with God in your heart, your desires will change and He will cause you to want to do what is right. And He will support you through the hard times as well. Choose true Salvation today and start a new life that you could never reach on your own. God is calling you. God is a living being and you can talk to Him like anyone else. This is all prayer is. Talking to God. If you have never surrendered your will and life to God, you can do it today, right where you are. He has a much better and fulfilling plan for your life. He will lift you up and never let you down. It is a decision that you need to make today and not put off till later. No one is guaranteed the next minute let alone the next few years. God wants the relationship between us and Him restored but he will not force His will on you. He wants you to want Him. There is no magic prayer.  Just tell God that you recognize that you are a sinner and cant save yourself and that you want Him to come in to your life and take control as lord and savior. He is waiting to restore the relationship with you but He wont wait forever.   </p><br>
