255 lessons that I have learned in 55 years. Updated 8/16/09, 8/25/19, 7/29/20, 2/13/24, 5/19/24, and 8/26/24. My observations are not based on public opinion and are shared as real life lessons as apposed to propaganda and the theories found in modern "education". This is not everything and not profound, but here it is. This list will be under construction until 10/10/2024.<br><br>

If I had children, I would teach them...
<br><br>001) In real life there is no "normal". 90% of life is beyond our control.
<br><br>002) The one true God is the very real, living, faithful, perfect, divine being.
<br><br>003) Microsoft is the follower, not the leader.
<br><br>004) Living for money is unsatisfying.
<br><br>005) School is the box that people try to "think outside of".
<br><br>006) Investing for the future assumes you will have one.
<br><br>007) Just because a company is large it does not make it automaticly worth following or right.
<br><br>008) Insurance is a scam. There are better breaks for the uninsured.
<br><br>009) You do NOT need a credit card to build good credit. Any regular payments do it.
<br><br>010) Marriage, along with traditional family values, the Bible, and prayer, is under rated.
<br><br>011) Gods word is practical, not just mundane rules and history or "religeon". 
<br><br>012) Most rednecks are in the cities. They cant do anything without a contractor.
<br><br>013) Investors are the training wheels that many companies never out grow.
<br><br>014) The military is a controlled environment, not like real life.
<br><br>015) Love, freedom, and financial stability, are gifts. Not a right.
<br><br>016) Social standards are not moral or acceptable.
<br><br>017) Most people who claim to want justice, really want mercy.
<br><br>018) The common sense of the amature is rocket science to the professional.
<br><br>019) The more stuff you have, the more it costs to maintain and protect it.
<br><br>020) Doctors, hospitals, police, security, and government, are NOT above the law.
<br><br>021) Excessive expectations are the cause of much frustration and depression.
<br><br>022) Gambling requires a lot of losers per winner. (Stock Market, lotto, 401K, real estate, etc.)
<br><br>023) It is better to own very little, than to be in debt for a lot. Strive to live debt free.
<br><br>024) A concept being endorsed by professionals does not make it right or best.
<br><br>025) Communication is key in all relationships. Never "assume".
<br><br>026) Not all entertainment is a waste of time and money.

<br><br>028) Fashion, style, and trendiness are just marketing scams.
<br><br>029) Joy is better than happiness. And far more stable. Only from Jesus Christ.
<br><br>030) Sensationalism and emotionalism are fleeting. Truth from God is eternal.

<br><br>032) Experience is a far more honest teacher than school.
<br><br>033) Entertainment and the Bible deserve equal time.
<br><br>034) Some of us don't have to learn everything the hard way. Smart people learn from others' mistakes.
<br><br>035) Equality is a mask for domination. Be honest about what you want.
<br><br>036) Unity at the cost of standards is counterproductive.
<br><br>037) Everyone wants to be accepted. What matters is "by whom?".
<br><br>038) Fat is lighter than muscle. If you build muscle and lose fat, the weight scale may go up.
<br><br>039) 7-8 hours of sleep per night is not optional and prevents medical problems.

<br><br>043) Education is not a guarantee of employment as they advertise but it helps.
<br><br>044) Sin is based on irresponsibility. The "you cant tell me what to do" routine.
<br><br>045) Self esteem and self respect are critical and are different than pride.

<br><br>052) Churches often water down Christianity to be more "modern".

<br><br>059) Sleep, water, exercise, and intake control, are all you need for weight loss.
<br><br>060) ***Real life experience always supercedes expert theory.***

<br><br>063) Speed and quality (or accuracy) are also at opposite ends of the same line.

<br><br>117) Moderation is critical in life but it can be a hard ballance to maintain.
<br><br>118) Polarized A/C plugs are pointless. The nature of A/C is alternating. No set polarity like DC.

<br><br>148) The desire for sex is God given and good, not dirty, within the boundries of Gods' intention for it.

<br>(Life + medical + dental + vision + perscription + hearing + supplemental + auto repair + renters + co-pay + deductables.)
<br>Average rate for all above: $500 per month X 12 months X 55 years = $330,000.00 saved (1969-2024).
<br><br>158) For best performance, reboot your devices at least once a week. (Computer, cell phone, console, router, etc.)
<br><br>159) Avoid impulse purchases (snacks at the check out, etc) and shop with a list to keep you on track.

<br><br>194) One can be a "genius" academicly and a total failure morally, ethicly, socially, and rationally.
<br><br>195) The spiritual world is just as real at the physical world. Denial does not change facts.

<br><br>197) Good, Christian, fundamental, spiritual, friends are priceless. No man is an island.

<br><br>215) Having your own children is a blessing but absolutly not best for everyone.
